    I do many other things, but not as much as the other stuff.(mostly due to the fact that
    i spend any time I have on home work, so i do things that can start and stop easily
    whenever i need to).

<p> I play Magic: The gathering, which is a card game, and Warhammer, wich is this model building
thing.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>I enjoy these things because they both rely on luck and skill. Magic is easier to set up and start playing but
warrhammer involves actually building and painting models.</p>
